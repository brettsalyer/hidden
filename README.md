The Hidden
==========
The Hidden (likely to change) is a game developed in Unity. This game was inspired by an indie game called "Last Man Standing".
The objective of this game is simple: find the humans and take them down. The opposing humans will be in a custom character model 
and it is your job to spot them and take them down. Failing to take down the correct person can result in exposing yourself, ultimiately leading to your demise. You can also equip different strategic items to assist you on your mission!
